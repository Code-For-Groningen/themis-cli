# themis-cli
[Inspired by @Stylo2k](https://github.com/Stylo2k/Perist-ri)  

CLI tool for you to upload your code to themis, and get feedback.

## File hierarchy
* When you start solving a lab/assignment, take a look at the URL and look for the course and the assignment names.  
E.g.  
```
https://themis.housing.rug.nl/course/2023-2024/progfun/tutorial4/
                                              ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ 
                                              course   assignment 
```

## Roadmap

* [ ] Create file structure
* [ ] Get (the available) inputs and outputs
* [ ] Submit succesfully
* [ ] Get & render test case outcome
